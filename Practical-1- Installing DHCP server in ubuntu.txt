Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks,
thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP.
A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.
Features of DHCP server:
DHCPOFFER
DHCPREQUEST
DHCPDISCOVER
DHCPDECLINE
DHCPRELEASE
DHCPINFORM
DHCPACK/DHCPNAK

Steps:
Command to install dhcp-server:  $sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server

Then configure your dhcpd.conf by directly editing through a path : $sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

You can get to know about your ip address by: $ip a (or)  $ip addr

We then configure the subnet  and the netmask , then save the file and exit

Then to enable the services use the command: $sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server.service

Then start the service : $sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server.service
