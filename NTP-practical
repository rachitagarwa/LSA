The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol used to synchronize computer system clock automatically over a networks. 
The machine can have the system clock use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than local time.

Maintaining accurate time on Linux systems especially servers is a important task for many reasons. For example, in a networked environment, 
accurate timekeeping is required for accurate timestamps in packets and system logs for root-cause analysis, determining when problems occurred, and finding correlations.
