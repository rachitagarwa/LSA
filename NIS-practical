•	NIS stands for Network Information Systems.
•	NIS, or Network Information Systems, is a network service that allows authentication and login information to be	stored on a centrally located server.
•	This includes the username and password database for login authentication, database of user groups, and the locations of home directories.
•	NIS-sharing flat files (sharing resources).
•	Files stored on certain machines, kind of database, can be queried, in tabular form, at least one column should be there.
•	It is kind of database in which each table has unique  key, one or more column.
•	And with query we	need to identify it.
•	There	are 2  types:
•	1. Master – Main	Server
•	2. Slave – Secondary server, load balancing
•	If master server goes down then the Slave can take over	Master server.
•	Client	can join without server acceptance


COMMANDS & STEPS

1. First update kali:
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt update

2. Now install NIS:
   $ sudo apt-get install -y nis

3. Now user must configure NIS:
   $ sudo nano /etc/default/nis

- After opening /etc/default/nis file scroll down and see-
# Are we a NIS server and if so what kind (values: false, slave, master)?

- And write:
NISSERVER=master

- And then scroll below 
# Are we a NIS client?

- And write:
NISCLIENT=false

4. Take copy of NIS:
   $ sudo cp /etc/default/nis /etc/default/nis_client

5. In /etc/ypserv.securenets, we need to write our IP address and subnet mask:
   $ sudo nano /etc/ypserv.securenets

6. Now for gmake (GNU make - called simply make on Linux systems) is a tool to help you build a program from its source.
   $ which gmake
   $ sudo dpkg -S `which gmake`

7. Now start & check the status of ypserv:

- ypserv: yellow pages (directory), it's a server where a client can query to see what service is there. 
- ypbind: Client binds tools 
- ypxfrd: nis database is with master, this command sends the database to the slave (secondary server) - load balancing

   $ sudo systemctl start ypserv
   $ sudo systemctl status ypserv

8. Now run the yp:
   $ sudo /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

9. Now start & check status of NIS:
   $ sudo systemctl start nis
   $ sudo systemctl status nis

10. Restart and check status of rpcbind NIS:
    $ sudo systemctl restart rpcbind nis
    $ sudo systemctl status rpcbind nis

11. Now we need to Add a user:
    $ sudo adduser rachit

12. Now to make your user:
    $ cd /var/yp
    $ sudo make

13. Now add a hostname in /etc/host: (I’ve added kali.rachit )
    $ sudo nano /etc/hosts

14. In /etc/yp.conf/ write the domain and server
    In my case I’ve written domain as rachit and server as kali.rachit

    $ sudo nano /etc/yp.conf

15. Now, do $ ls -lrth
    $ cat ypservers

16. Now do hosts.byname name to see all your host name & domain name
    $ sudo cat hosts.byname
    $ sudo domainname
 
17. Now ping, just to check everything’s working:
    $ ping kali
    $ ping kali.rachit

18. Now again run the yp:
    ~$ sudo /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

19. Now configure nsswitch.conf for NIS:
- The Name Service Switch (NSS) configuration file, /etc/nsswitch.conf, is used by the GNU C Library and certain other applications 
  to determine the sources from which to obtain name-service information in a range of categories, and in what order.  
  
- Each category of information is identified by a database name.

    $ sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf

20. Now reboot Kali and Login with the user that we have added above:
    $ sudo reboot

21. If Login is successful then NIS server is working.
